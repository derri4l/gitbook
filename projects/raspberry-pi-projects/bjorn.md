# BJORN

### Overview&#x20;

In this project I deployed Bjorn, an open-source vulnerability scanner that runs on a pi zero and even other small boards out there. I have been a fan of this project since I found out about it because not only is it a low-powered cheap solution but its also fully customizable since it is built on python and Nmap.

The goal goal here is to utilize this tool for scanning through my network for all devices, ports, check for vulnerabilities and also try some dictionary attacks that are already part of Bjorn out of the box.

I will go into more detail on what kind of vulnerabilities and attacks that succeeded in the Security/SOC section of this portfolio.
