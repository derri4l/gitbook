# Project 1 - PI NAS

### What I'm I building?

This project involved setting up a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) with a Raspberry PI 5 and a 4 bay NVMe expansion board. In addition, this project was also intended to explore and implement firewall rules, remotely accessing files, and other features to simulate a secure server.



### Hardware&#x20;

* Raspberry Pi 5 &#x20;
* GeekPI N16 NVMe expansion board&#x20;
* 3x NVME SSDs
* Ethernet Cable
* MicroSD card&#x20;
* Power Cable



### Putting it all together&#x20;

* Assembled the NVMe expansion board and connected it with the PI.&#x20;
* Installed a headless version of Raspberry OS. &#x20;
* Installed OMV (OpenMediaVault) on top of Raspberry OS .&#x20;
