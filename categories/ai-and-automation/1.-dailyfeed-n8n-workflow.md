# #1. DailyFeed (n8n-workflow)

<h3 align="center">DailyFeed Workflow</h3>

This workflow automatically automates my daily feed collection. It pulls a curated RSS feed (mostly cybersecurity news), summarizes the top items with a LLM blurb, and drops them into my Discord channel. At the same time, it also checks the health of my homelab services by using Tailscale (all my services + the n8n VM live on the same tailnet).



<h3 align="center">Workflow overview</h3>

* **Trigger:** Manual trigger for testing → Schedule trigger for daily runs
* **News branch:**
  1. Grab curated RSS feed from RSS Maker
  2. Limit to top 8 items
  3. LLM rewrites summaries with a casual “here’s your news” intro
  4. Clean/format fields
  5. Push digest to Discord channel.

**Status branch:**

1. n8n VM (already on the tailnet) runs ping checks to homelab services over Tailscale IPs
2. LLM summarizes results into a short uptime message
3. Posts status to Discord channel.
