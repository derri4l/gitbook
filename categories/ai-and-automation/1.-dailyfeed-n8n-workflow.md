# #1. DailyFeed (n8n-workflow)

<h3 align="center">The DailyFeed </h3>

I made a automated process push things I check daily to my Discord. The way it works is it pulls a curated RSS feed (mostly cybersecurity news), summarizes the top items with a LLM blurb, and drops them into my Discord channel. At the same time, it also checks the health of my homelab services by using Tailscale (all my services + the n8n VM live on the same tailnet).



<h3 align="center">Workflow overview</h3>

* **Triggers:** Manual for testing, cron for production
* **News chain:** RSS → Limit → LLM → Edit Fields → Discord
* **Command chain:** Execute Command → LLM → Discord
* **Output:** Both branches end in separate Discord channels (news digest + status update)

<h3 align="center">Node highlights</h3>

1. **Basic LLM Chain (News Digest):**

* **Purpose:** Summarizes articles.
* &#x20;Uses OpenAI Chat Model (gpt 4 mini)

As you can see, this LLM chain takes the feed entries from the **Limit** node (left panel). In the middle, I defined the prompt so the LLM focuses on summarizing the article content. On the right, you can see the model’s summarized output, which I then pass downstream for formatting before it’s sent to Discord.



2. **Execute Command node + LLM chain (ping services):**

**Purpose:** Summarizes raw ping output into a human-friendly message.

This branch checks the status of my homelab services. On the left, the **Execute Command** node runs a simple ping -3 against each service’s IP. The raw ping results are passed into the **LLM chain**, where I prompt it to summarize whether each host is up or down.

<h3 align="center">Wrap-Up</h3>

This workflow ties together two of my daily needs: staying on top of cybersecurity news and keeping an eye on my homelab. With n8n, I don’t have to check feeds or run manual health checks it all lands in my Discord automatically.
