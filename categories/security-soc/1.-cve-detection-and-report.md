# #1. CVE Detection and Report

<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>

This report documents the results of the vulnerability scan using Bjorn, an open source pen-testing tool I built, (you can check it out by clicking on the link below). For this report i decided to run the vulnerability scan on a NAS running on OMV.

The purpose of this was to simulate a SOC-like report/analysis to identify any vulnerabilities on the NAS itself.&#x20;

Bjorn link:

{% content-ref url="../raspberry-pi-projects/2.-bjorn.md" %}
[2.-bjorn.md](../raspberry-pi-projects/2.-bjorn.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



<h3 align="center">Scanning methodology</h3>

* **Tool**: Bjorn (network scanner)
* **Target**: NAS&#x20;
* **Scope**: CVE matching from Vulners.com
* **Limitations**: Since this was done on Bjorn, checks were pretty surface level and were mostly based on the service version banners



<h3 align="center">What did I find </h3>

A lot. There were numerous CVE findings because the NAS was running on a very old version of Debian so it had everything you could think about in there. Nice thing about Bjorn is it compiles all its findings and exports them into a CSV file. Though the formatting is a little messy, its not impossible to straighten things out.&#x20;

I was able format the report into sections port, identifier, score and the link to learn more about the vulnerability. It can be downloaded in the drop down below.
