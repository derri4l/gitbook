# #1. CVE Detection and Report

<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>

This report documents the results of the vulnerability scan using Bjorn, an open source pen-testing tool I built, (you can check it out by clicking on the link below). For this assessment, I targeted a Network Attached Storage (NAS) running OpenMediaVault (OMV). The purpose was to simulate a SOC-style vulnerability analysis, identifying potential risks in a homelab.

{% endcontent-ref %}



<h3 align="center">Scanning methodology</h3>

* **Tool**: Bjorn (network scanner)
* **Target**: NAS&#x20;
* **Scope**: CVE matching from Vulners.com database
* **Limitations**: Since this was done on Bjorn, checks were pretty surface level and were mostly based on the service version banners



<h3 align="center">What did I find </h3>

A lot. Since the NAS was running on a pretty old version of Debian, Bjorn flagged just about everything you could think of. The scan came back with a long list of CVEs covering different services and packages.

The nice thing about Bjorn is that it doesn’t just spit out raw results, it actually bundles all the findings into a CSV file. The formatting is a little messy straight out of the tool, but with some cleanup I was able to get it into a readable format.

Once reformatted, the CVE report looks a lot more like something you’d hand off in a actual work setting. You can check out the cleaned version in the download below.

<h3 align="center">Some standout Vulnerabilities</h3>

One of the standouts from the scan was [SSV:93139](https://vulners.com/seebug/SSV:93139), a vulnerability tied to Samba. Since Samba is what powers file sharing on the NAS, this one is a big deal. It basically opens the door to remote code execution if left unpatched. For a device that’s literally holding all your data, that’s the last thing you want.

Another interesting find was [EDB-ID:42060](https://vulners.com/exploitdb/EDB-ID:42060), this vulnerability affects Samba versions 3.5.0 and above, allowing an attacker to upload a shared library to a writable Samba share and then execute it remotely. In practice, this means a simple SMB connection could be abused to gain full remote code execution on the target system.



<h3 align="center">Patching</h3>

* Update Samba to the latest patched release (≥ 4.6.4 or any vendor-patched build).
* Restrict writable Samba shares.
* Limit SMB exposure to trusted networks only.



<h3 align="center">Conclusion</h3>

The scan made it clear that outdated services can stack up vulnerabilities fast. Highlighting issues like SambaCry and OpenSSH shows why patching and regular scans matter. Even in a homelab, staying updated is key to keeping systems secure.
