# #2. Bjorn

### _What is Bjorn?_

So, I’ve been keeping an eye on this project for a while and finally decided it was time to give it a spin. **Bjorn** is an open-source pen-testing tool with a ton of personality. Personally, I’m a big fan of the Viking theme; it makes scanning feel a lot less boring. It’s a super lightweight tool that can run on tiny boards like the Pi Zero, yet still packs a punch with automated network scanning, vulnerability assessments, and even some dictionary attacks.



### _Putting it together_

#### Hardware

* Pi zero with headers
* SD card&#x20;
* E paper display
* Micro usb cable&#x20;

Putting Bjorn together is pretty straight-foward, if you have the Pi with headers you just have to slap the display on top of it run the automated installation script on from the github below and that's pretty much it.

#### Software&#x20;

So for this step you would have to clone the repo from [**https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn**](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn) , this github has pretty much everything  you would need for the install including steps, FAQs, etc.



### Actual fun stuff

#### Getting connected

Upon first connection Windows recognized something was plugged in but there wasnt any devices, tuns out Bjorn uses RNDIS drivers over usb which makes Bjorn show up as a network device. So after that was done, docs recommended to set the network device to a manual IP of 10.0.0.1 which assigns Bjorn with 10.0.0.2 automatically.&#x20;

From that point you can ssh in with the default credentials or whatever was set during the installation script. Next thing i did was go to the GUI.
