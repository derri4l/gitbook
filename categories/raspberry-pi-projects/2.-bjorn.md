# #2. Bjorn

### _What is Bjorn?_

So, I’ve been keeping an eye on this project for a while and finally decided it was time to give it a spin. **Bjorn** is an open-source pen-testing tool with a ton of personality. Personally, I’m a big fan of the Viking theme; it makes scanning feel a lot less boring. It’s a super lightweight tool that can run on tiny boards like the Pi Zero, yet still packs a punch with automated network scanning, vulnerability assessments, and even some dictionary attacks.



### _Putting it together_

#### Hardware

* Pi zero with headers
* SD card&#x20;
* E paper display
* Micro usb cable&#x20;

Putting Bjorn together is pretty straight-foward, if you have the Pi with headers you just have to slap the display on top of it run the automated installation script on from the github below and that's pretty much it.

#### Software&#x20;

So for this step you would have to clone the repo from [**https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn**](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn) , this github has pretty much everything  you would need for the install including steps, FAQs, etc.



### Actual fun stuff

Okay so Bjorn has a web interface that is super useful since we can't control anything from the screen. So first thing is to plug Bjorn into your computer. If its a windows you may need to install RNDIS drivers to make make sure that it shows up as a network device.  Next, you just have to find the IP that is assigned to Bjorn (connecting to your wifi and getting an IP is part of that installation script).&#x20;

By default the web GUI runs on port 8000, so to reach it you would do ( ip:8000)
