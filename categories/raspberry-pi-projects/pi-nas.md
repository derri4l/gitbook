# Pi NAS

### _What is the goal?_

This goal of this project was to be able to build a low powered and secured NAS, I also wanted to push it beyond its primary usage as storage for files and have it be a small server to host some lightweight services.



### _Hardware_&#x20;

* Raspberry Pi 5 &#x20;
* GeekPI N16 NVMe expansion board&#x20;
* 3x NVME SSDs
* Ethernet Cable
* MicroSD card&#x20;
* Power Cable

### _Putting it all together_&#x20;

The first thing I did was to assemble the GeekPi board to the Pi itself. The board itself has a USB port that supplies power to both the board and the PI, it also supports 4 NVME SSDs  in various sizes. In this project i only used 3.&#x20;

The board connects to the Pi via a flexible PCIe ribbon cable. Power is supplied through PD to the board, which then feeds the Pi through pogoâ€‘pin contacts underneath. Inside the board is an ASM1184e PCIe switch that splits the single x1 lane into four ports.

### _Software & Storage configuration_

Since this project is being done on a Pi, there were pretty limited options when it came to a software NAS distro. I ended up going with OMV (OpenMediaVault). OMV is a NAS distro that supports software RAID, and multiple protocols including FTP, SMB, NFS etc.&#x20;

I chose to go with RAID 5 with the 3 SSDs I had installed. After setting up the array I also created the RAID volume, created multiple shared folders. To make sure our file sharing is cross-platform I enabled SMB/CIFS allowing users on Winodows, mac or linux to be able to map and access the drives.

### _User Access_&#x20;

The next thing I did was to create user profiles for the people I wanted to give access to the NAS. Each user had read/write access over the shared folder provisioned for them. I also created assigned groups with tailored permissions just in case I had to add more users or switch permissions for an existing one.

### _Security_

This NAS is behind my firewall and has custom rules targeted to it already but I did add and change a few things that will contribute to security. First thing I did was to change the default port for SSH and GUI login. I also disabled password login for SSH and enabled key authentication only.

I also disabled root login for ssh and only allowed an admin to login via SSH and then switch to root if needed.

I also installed Fail2ban on top of the NAS. Fail2ban is like a lightweight IPS that monitors logs and creates jails to ban IP addresses, and you can set your own custom rules. I mainly have it work side by side with the firewall to protect against brute-force attacks.
